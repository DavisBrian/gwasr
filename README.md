# gwasr

The goal of gwasr is to provide a common structure and interface for conducting
GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies).

The goal is to provide a robust set of tools to interface with various GWAS 
testing methods and elimnate (or at least catch early) common analysis mistakes.


## Installation

gwasr is currently not on CRAN, but you can get it from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavisBrian/gwasr")
```

## Usage / Examples

The following example uses gwasr to solve a fairly realistic problem: With phenotype, genotype, and a snpinfo file for each "gene", run a T5 test.
